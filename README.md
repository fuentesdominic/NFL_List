# *NFL Teams*

## Description 

The NFL consists of 32 teams. That's a lot of oranizations to keep track of. In this project you can checkout what team belongs in each division and what conference they represent. In the top right corner on the home page you can also create a team of your own! While we are stoaked to see unique teams you create, we also give you the option to delete the custom team.

## Navigating 

- The Home page gives you two options to choose from *NFC* and *AFC*.
- The next page has all the conferences from the division you picked, you can pick whatever conference you desire.
- From here you have the icons of all teams from that conference, select a certain team and view the details about that team including players!
- You have the option of creating new players, editing players positions, and deleting current players.
- There's a home button on the top left if you desire to go back to the home page.

## Technology Used

`JavaScript`, `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, `React`, `Node.js`, `CSS`

## Future changes

There is always room for improvement! As soon as possible I would like to make the feature to add players as a button in the header. I would also like to allow users to edit the entire team. Another feature I would like to add is the ability to view photos of the teams facility when you are viewing their details.
